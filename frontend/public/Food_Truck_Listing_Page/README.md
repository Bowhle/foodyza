Create a page to display a list of food trucks, including filtering by cuisine type and sorting by distance.

Based on user story:

As a busy professional, I want to quickly find food trucks near my location so that I can order lunch without wasting time walking to a distant mall.

Checklist:

Design and implement the layout (filtering options, sorting options, food truck list).

Implement filtering by cuisine type.

Implement sorting by distance (requires integration with map/location API).

Display food truck information (name, cuisine, distance, rating, image).

Implement pagination for large lists.

Write unit tests for filtering, sorting, and display components.
